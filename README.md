# Image Carousel

This repository holds a JavaScript image carousel component built from scratch.  The carousel cycles through a set of images automatically and includes buttons to navigate forward or backward.  It uses CSS transitions for smooth sliding animations and vanilla JS to handle timing and user interactions.  By building this component I learned about DOM manipulation, event listeners, and controlling intervals.  To see it in action, open `index.html` in a browser and watch the images slide.
